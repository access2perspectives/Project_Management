Digital Project Management for Science

Scientists often run three or more highly complex projects in parallel. On top of that, a growing number of publishers and funding agencies require scientists to make their raw data available upon publication according to the four foundational principles – Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR). To ensure goal-oriented and time efficient management of both raw data and scientific projects in general we will discuss selected established as well as emerging tools and techniques complementing the basic principles of classical project management.


- Components of Science Project Management
- Aspects of Time and Team Management
